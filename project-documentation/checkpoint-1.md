# Mandry Software Landing Page - Checkpoint 1

## Completed Items

### 1. Project Setup
- Created new Vite React project using `npm create vite@latest`
- Installed necessary dependencies:
  - TailwindCSS
  - PostCSS
  - Autoprefixer
  - Headless UI
  - Lucide React
  - Date-fns

### 2. Project Structure
Created the following directory structure:
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── layout/
│   │   ├── Header.jsx
│   │   ├── Footer.jsx
│   │   └── Layout.jsx
│   ├── ui/
│   │   ├── TimeBasedImage.jsx
│   │   ├── Logo.jsx
│   │   └── Button.jsx
│   └── sections/
│       └── Hero.jsx
├── hooks/
│   └── useTimeOfDay.js
├── utils/
│   └── timeUtils.js
├── assets/
│   └── images/
└── styles/
    └── globals.css
```

### 3. Component Skeletons
Created basic skeleton components with:
- Proper file structure
- Basic JSX structure
- PropTypes where needed
- Tailwind CSS classes setup

### 4. Configuration Files
- Set up TailwindCSS configuration
- Updated global CSS with Tailwind directives
- Configured main.jsx for proper imports

### 5. Modern React Best Practices Implemented
- Removed unnecessary React imports (React 17+ standard)
- Added PropTypes for type checking
- Established consistent component structure
- Set up proper directory organization

## Current Status
- Project builds successfully
- Basic component structure renders
- Development environment is fully configured

## Next Steps

### 1. Implement Core Functionality
- Complete useTimeOfDay hook implementation
- Create time-based image transitions
- Set up dynamic logo changes

### 2. Component Development (in order)
1. Header Component
   - Logo implementation
   - Navigation menu
   - Mobile responsiveness
2. Hero Section
   - Time-based background
   - Content layout
   - Responsive design
3. Footer Component
   - Dynamic date/time
   - Email subscription form
   - Responsive layout

### 3. Image Assets
- Generate logo variations using Midjourney
- Create hero image variations
- Implement image optimization

### 4. Testing
- Component testing
- Responsive design testing
- Time-based transitions testing

### 5. Performance Optimization
- Image optimization
- Component lazy loading
- Performance testing

## Development Notes
- React basics are set up correctly
- Modern React patterns are being followed
- Mobile-first approach is ready to be implemented
- Project is ready for component-by-component development

## Technical Decisions Made
1. Using Vite instead of Create React App for better performance
2. Implemented PropTypes for type checking
3. Set up dark mode by default
4. Organized components by feature/function
5. Using functional components with hooks

## Environment Details
- Node.js installed
- Using npm as package manager
- Windows 11 development environment
- Cursor IDE
- Vite development server

## Resources Needed for Next Phase
1. Midjourney access for image generation
2. GIMP/Inkscape for image editing
3. Asset optimization tools

This checkpoint represents the completion of the initial setup phase. The project is now ready for active development of individual components and features.

# This is just a test to see how changes are handled.
